# = Epoxy - bind data to queries for any query language.
# 
# Let me hit ya with some science!
# 
#     ep = Epoxy.new("select * from foo where bar=?")
#     binds = %W[foo]
#     bound_query = ep.quote { |x| "'" + binds[x] + "'" }
#     "select * from foo where bar='foo'"
# 
# Epoxy handles:
# 
# * ? for numbered binds (named binds coming soon!)
# * ?? for a *real* question mark
# * '?' for a *real* question mark
# * comments, weird quoting styles (look at the "holy shit" test for examples)
# * not telling you how to quote your data. This solution works for any query language and any database.
